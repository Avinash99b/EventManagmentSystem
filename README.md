# Event Management API

This repository contains the Event Management API project. The backend is implemented in Node.js + Express with TypeScript following an MVC architecture. PostgreSQL is used as the primary datastore and a Docker Compose setup is included for quick local development.

See `backend/README.md` for backend-specific setup and running instructions.
